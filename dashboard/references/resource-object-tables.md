## 1. Data Responsibilities

An instance list answers "what is this resource?" while telemetry charts answer "how is this resource operating?"

When resource-catalog or custom-object data exists, the instance list must prefer an object query:

```dql
CO::service_object:(last(`instance_name`), last(`region_id`), last(`status`), last(`size`)) { `account_name` = '#{account_name}' and `instance_id` = '#{instance_id}' } BY `instance_id`
```

Corresponding query metadata:

```json
{
  "namespace": "custom_object",
  "dataSource": "service_object",
  "groupBy": ["instance_id"]
}
```

Do not construct an instance table with `M::... BY node_id, shard_id`. Metric families can use different tag granularities, and instance-level series may produce `<nil>` for node or shard tags.

## 2. Input Acceptance

Before generating an instance-property table, obtain object JSON or CSV and verify:

- the object measurement or class is explicit
- at least one real resource record exists rather than only a field template
- platform metadata, object top-level fields, and a nested `message` payload can be distinguished
- queryable fields include real values and types, with top-level fields distinguished from nested `message` paths
- required account, readable instance name, and stable instance ID fields exist
- unit metadata, API version, and update time are retained when available

If this input is missing, stop instance-table generation and request an object export. Do not substitute metric tags, invented sample fields, or an official documentation example for an object sample from the user's environment.

## 3. Field Selection

Order columns as follows:

1. account, region, and project; include cloud vendor only when the dashboard is not already vendor-specific
2. instance name; include the instance ID only when users need it for disambiguation or cross-system lookup
3. architecture, version, protocol, and specification
4. resource status and service status; include billing type only when its semantics are confirmed and operationally useful
5. private address, port, VPC, and subnet
6. capacity, shard count, and per-shard capacity
7. feature switches, creation time, and update time

Prefer top-level fields that exist in the real object sample. When an operationally useful property exists only in `message`, a sample-backed `@json-path` may be queried after it passes `dqlcheck`. Do not treat a fixed array index such as `@Items[0]` as wildcard, explode, or unnest behavior; use a separate child-resource object or a clearly time-window-dependent telemetry table when a complete node, shard, or listener list is required.

Query identity and display columns are separate concerns. Keep a stable resource ID in filters and `BY` when it prevents collisions, but do not expose it as a table column when a readable name is sufficient. The same applies to project IDs, VPC IDs, subnet IDs, and other implementation identifiers: show them only when they help the target operator act on the resource.

Do not display every available object field. Omit fixed context, redundant identifiers, and opaque low-value enums. When removing a visible column, also remove stale alias, visible-field, width, unit, and mapping entries for that column; the identity field may remain in DQL filters or `BY`.

## 4. Detect Enum Candidates

Pay particular attention when:

- a field name contains `status`, `state`, `mode`, `type`, `arch`, `edition`, or `bill`
- a field name contains `enabled`, `supported`, or `protection`
- numeric or boolean samples contain only a few discrete values
- a raw number is unreadable while the product console displays a business label

Low cardinality is a reason to research an enum, not evidence from which to infer its meaning automatically.

## 5. Generate Value Mappings

Confirm value semantics with the SKILL's Official Field Research route. Do not maintain vendor-specific data dictionaries in this generic reference.

Use the exact query result field, such as `last(status)`:

```json
{
  "field": "last(status)",
  "operation": "=",
  "queryCode": "A",
  "mappingVal": "Running",
  "originalVal": ["2"]
}
```

Requirements:

- `field` must exactly match the DQL return field.
- `queryCode` must match the query.
- `originalVal` must use the UI string representation of the real return type.
- One field and original value may have only one `mappingVal`.
- Prefer the complete official data dictionary rather than mapping only values observed in the sample.
- Do not mix unconfirmed values into confirmed mappings.
- If an unconfirmed enum is operationally important, preserve the raw value and document the evidence gap. If it is optional and unreadable, omit the column instead of adding noise.
- Generate `valColorMappings` only when status coloring is useful; do not create redundant entries whose colors are all empty.

## 6. Boolean Fields

Distinguish current state from capability:

- `*_enabled`: `Enabled` / `Disabled`
- `*_supported`: `Supported` / `Unsupported`

Check the real type and cover `0/1`, `true/false`, or string representations when appropriate. Do not label "supported" as though a feature were currently enabled.

## 7. Units and Special Values

- Obtain units from the object schema or current first-party API and specification documentation; do not guess from field names.
- Distinguish `GB` from `Gb` and `MB` from `Mb`.
- `0` may be a valid capacity or may mean not applicable; only official documentation and architecture context can decide.
- When a condition cannot be represented accurately by static `valMappings`, use a conservative label such as `Not Sharded` or `Not Applicable`, or preserve the original value and document the limitation.

## 8. Validation

- The instance-table DQL begins with `CO::`.
- The object input source is recorded and contains at least one real object record.
- `namespace` is `custom_object`.
- `dataSource` is the real object measurement or class.
- `BY` uses a stable resource ID and does not mix in metric-granularity tags.
- Every queried top-level field or `@json-path` exists in the object sample, and every `@json-path` passes `dqlcheck`.
- Fixed array indexes are not used to present a complete child-resource list.
- Headers are readable through `alias` or `fieldMapping`.
- Unit settings match object semantics.
- Every displayed enum candidate is mapped or has a documented reason for preserving the original value.
- `valMappings` contains no duplicate conflicts and covers observed values where evidence is sufficient.
